Welcome to a VERY basic command-line chess: Player versus Player (possible computer AI to add later!)!

This was made while working through The Odin Project curriculum. I used the key codes for white and black chess shapes (UTF), which can make things a bit harder to see on the terminal windows, however, if you zoom in on the text it should make things a bit easier!

Enjoy!!
